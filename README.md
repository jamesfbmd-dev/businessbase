# BusinessBase Website

This is the front-end code for the BusinessBase website.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and Gulp installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Gulp task:**
   ```bash
   npx gulp
   ```
   This will compile the SCSS to CSS and watch for any changes you make to the SCSS files.
